=====

This is the software component of a Stenography keyboard based on the
MSP430FR series Microcontroller.

Initially it is intended to:
- Operate on the MSP430FR5739 (and similar)
- Implement a direct key-for-key (not grid) keyboard with 23+ GPIO/Keys.
	(to maximize time in sleep mode waiting for interruptis.)
- Implement a local circular log in FRAM.
- Implement the GemeniPR Serial interface.
- Run in a headless mode from battery for an inordinately long amount of time.

** It does not currently meet these goals. **

Later plans are:
- Support for more serial output protocols
- Support for newer MSP430FR chips
- An i2c+1 GPIO output protocol
- A hardware dictionary (SPI, I2c?)
- A hardware display
